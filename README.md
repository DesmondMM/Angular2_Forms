> A bare bones, sanity check Angular 2 app

This project shows you how to create the simplest possible Angular 2 app.

## Dependencies

Before you get started, you need to make sure you have node.js installed. We'll be using `npm` to run this project (`npm` will be installed when you install node.js). You can [install node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installing

First, you need to make sure you install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then we will 

- compile our TypeScript code and
- host the app on local development server 

by running the command:

```
npm run go
```

Change `"serve": "./node_modules/.bin/live-server --host=192.168.178.52 --port=8080 .",` to
        `"serve": "./node_modules/.bin/live-server --host=localhost --port=8080 .",` in packages.json

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
